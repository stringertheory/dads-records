# Dad's Records

### Steps

1. move images into `vinyl` directory

2. run `get_album_image_info.py` to make spreadsheet with artist/album names

3. run `add_to_discogs.py spreadsheet_path` to add to "BeepBopBoop" folder in discogs

### Notes

discogs username: `tomstringer`

This will not necessarily get the correct release in discogs for every
album. After everything is there, we could look at how variable the
value is for different releases for each album, and then use that to
make a short list of albums to check more thoroughly to see if it's
worth $$$.
